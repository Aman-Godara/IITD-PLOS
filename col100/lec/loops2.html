<h4>For loops continued</h4>
<p>Another example: add up the first 100 numbers
<pre>
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
  sum = sum + i;
}
cout << "The sum is " << sum << endl;
</pre>

<p>General form of for-loop:
<pre>
for (init-statement; check; step-statement)
{
  statement;
  statement;
  ...
}
</pre>
Show the flowchart: first init-statement executes, followed by check, and so on.  If the check is false at the first entry to the loop, the body is never executed. The init-statement or the step-statement could be empty. Also, point out that the init-statement could be anything, e.g., declaration, assignment, function call, another for-loop, etc. Same for step-statement.

<p>Why do we need the for-loop when we already have the while loop? More structure, better readability. e.g., if we just want to count, for loop has much better readability than the while loop.

<p><code>sum = sum + i</code> can also be written as <code>sum += i</code>.</p>

<p>While without braces:
<pre>
while (condition)
  statement;
</pre>
If only one statement in body, can omit left and right braces (just like if statement). Similarly for for loop.

<h4>Nested loops</h4>
A loop placed inside another loop
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
  for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
  {
    cout << "*";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
</pre>
Could we have ommitted the braces in the for loop here?

<p>Output:
<pre>
**********
**********
**********
**********
**********
</pre>
The outer loop repeats five times; the inner loop repeats ten times

<h4>Exercise: What is produced by the following code</h4>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
  for (int j = 0; j < i + 1; j++)
  {
    cout << "*";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
</pre>
