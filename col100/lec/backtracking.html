<h2>Exhaustive search and backtracking</h2>
<b>Exhaustive search</b>: exploring every possible combination from a set of choices or values
<ul>
<li>Often implemented recursively</li>
<li>Sometimes called <em>recursive enumeration</em></li>
</ul>
Applications:
<ul>
<li>producing all permutations of a set of values</li>
<li>enumerating all possible names, passwords, etc.</li>
<li>solving puzzles/games, e.g., Sudoku, Chess.</li>
</ul>
Often the search space consists of many <b>decisions</b>, each of which has several available <b>choices</b>.
<ul>
<li>Example: when enumerating all 5-letter strings, each of the 5 letters is a <em>decision</em>, and each of those decisios has 26 possible <em>choices</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>General pseudo-code algorithm for exhaustive search:


<pre>
printAllBinaryHelper(int digits, string soFar)
{
}
