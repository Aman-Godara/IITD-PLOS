<h3> Getting started with an empty project on QtCreator</h3><br>

<p> Running from QT Creator.</p><br>

<p> 1. Download <a href="https://stanford.edu/~stepp/cppdoc/dist/empty-project.zip">empty-project.zip</a></p><br>

<p> 2. Extract it to place of your choice. </p><br>

<p> 3. Start QtCreator and select open project. </p><br>

<p> 4. Select empty_project.pro within the extracted directory.</p><br>

<p>5. Open that.  Click Configure project </p><br>

<p> 6. In the source tree. Sources/src/hello.cpp contains the sample 
hello.cpp (Hello world code). You can add another cpp file to this 
folder, but there should only be one main() functions. Just rename the 
one of the main() as main_old() or something of your choice. </p><br>

<p> 7. Modify this file as per the lab requirements. It will be able to use 
all the files in the stanfordlib folder.</p><br>

<p> 8. Ctrl+B to build and Ctrl+R to run. Please note that the first run 
will take time as it will build the library.</p>
