<h1>Analysis of COL100 student grade data vis-a-vis prior CS exposure</h1>
by Sorav Bansal (for COL100 Oversight Committee)<br>
<p><b>Analysis reports prepared by Suban</b><ol>
<li><a href=http://10.10.111.112/plots/CS/>http://10.10.111.112/plots/CS/</a>: this set of analyses seems to purport that prior CS exposure is positively correlated with COL100 grade, and so there may be a causal relation between the two.</li>
<li><a href=http://10.10.111.112/plots/CS/COL100-semI-2018-2019/>http://10.10.111.112/plots/CS/COL100-semI-2018-2019/</a>: this set of results is for COL100 offering in the first semester of 2018-2019; however prior CS exposure data is not used in this analysis; not sure what to make of this.</li>
<li>Some high-level curriculum analyses (I could not find their relevance to our current discussion on COL100):<ol type='a'><li>

</ol>
<p><b>Facts based on data below</b> (I hope we can agree on them):<ol>
<li>I could only find prior-CS-exposure data for 2014-entry and 2015-entry students (confirmed by Suban).</li>
<li>There is a clear correlation between prior-CS-exposure and final COL100 grade (confirms Suban's results)</li>
<li>Just to be completely sure, I also tried to see the statistics after removing all students who received a D or less (E/F/W/NF) while computing percentages (see columns titled non-weak students). In any case, the correlations remain largely similar, irrespective of whether we consider the weak students or not.</li>
<li>However, there is also a clear correlation between prior-CS-exposure and final MTL100 grades.  I picked another first-year course (MTL100) to see if the correlation is unique to COL100 or not.</li>
<li>I do see slightly higher correlations for COL100 (than MTL100), say a few percentage points here or there, but nothing significant.</li>
<li>The fact that both MTL100 and COL100 show similar correlations with prior-CS-exposure is clear evidence that the correlations are not causal. <b>In fact there is no evidence that prior CS exposure presents a statistically significant advantage to students for COL100 specifically.</b> (something I find surprising).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>My (humble) inferences and opinions</b>:<ol type="a">
<li>For COL100 (and for all other courses actually), it is very clear that we get two categories of students based on their socio-economic backgrounds; let's call them "haves" and "have-nots" for lack of a better terminology. This categorization is not just based on this data, but also based on my experience teaching several subjects over the past around ten years at IITD. Perhaps the haves have better access to resources, teachers, exposure, etc., I cannot say.</li>
<li>A fair treatment should involve separate handling of these two categories of students; the have-nots should be started with more introductory material, while the haves can be started at a more advanced level. As far as I can tell, all of us agree on this aspect of our intake</li>
<li>However, there are several practical issues with this, the most of important of which IMHO is: how do we distinguish the two categories; we need to worry about both precision and also care about being politically and socially correct in our categorization. Doing this practically in a curriculum-wide manner seems too hard to even attempt.</li>
<li>This is the exact same effect that is playing out for COL100 too; but COL100 is definitely not unique in witnessing this effect. The data below shows that MTL100 has the exact same issue, and I would not be surprised at all if more courses show the same issue.</li>
<li>It just so happens that the two categories are also correlated with their typical class XII subjects; in particular, the haves seem to have more percentage of people who take CS in class XII. But treating these correlations as causal effects is wrong, as seen through MTL data: even though their class XII CS course has nothing to do with MTL100 syllabus, students with prior CS exposure still seem to score higher on MTL100. In my opinion, this indicates that it is not their CS exposure but other issues that have causal effects both on their class XII subjects and their grades in IIT courses.</li>
<li>At this point, I will not argue against a two-step COL100. However, if COL100 is made two-step, IMHO the criteria for deciding who needs one step vs. who needs two steps, cannot be based on their prior CS exposure, as we have just established that prior CS exposure is an incidentally correlated effect and not a cause for their COL100 performance.
<ul><li>To use a crude analogy, let's say that in the context of reservation, the government is interested in supporting historically oppressed sections of the society; it also so happens that the oppressed sections of the society have shorter height on average, due to some nutritional correlation; based on this, should the government start making short height as the criteria for reservations? In other words, we should not fall into the trap of trying to cure the symptom and thus overlooking the cause.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Finally: if COL100 is made two-step, IMHO we must also advocate MTL100 (and similarly other courses) to also be considered for making two-step in the same breath. Why should this be a COL100 specific issue?</li>
</ol>
Overall, based on the last two bullets, in my opinion, I really do not see why we should advocate a two-step CS introduction for a subset of students. If anything, we should at least get rid of arbitrary requirements like "prior CS exposure", and base it solely on a waiver test. But again, why just COL100?
