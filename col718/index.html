<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
This course will briefly review the fundamentals of
Computer Architecture and move on to topics related to design
and programming of high-performance computers, including architectural
features, compiler support and OS support.
We recommend that
you should have done a UG-level Computer Architecture course, and preferrably
courses on compiler design/optimization and UG-level OS.
If you are interested in taking this course, but do not
meet these pre-requisites, please write to me
with your CV/resume and I can guide you based on your background.

<p>The official pre-requisite is (see <a href=http://www.iitd.ac.in/sites/default/files/semsch/CouStudy_201819.pdf>courses of study</a>):
<ul>
<li>COL 216 : Computer Architecture</li>
</ul>
or equivalent.

<h2>Why study architecture of high-performance computers?</h2>
With a saturation in the clock-speeds of a computer, several new ideas
have been developed/proposed to obtain the next level of performance
improvements in computer systems. These ideas usually span multiple system
layers including architecture, compiler-support, and OS-support.
Given the highly evolving nature of modern compute-intensive workloads,
this is one of the busiest areas of research in computer science today.

<h2>Course topics</h2>
Following are the tentative course topics; the exact topics will evolve as
we go along the course
<ul>
<li>Integer instruction sets and their evolution : in particular, we will study the modern x86 instruction set in detail.</li>
<li>Floating-point instruction sets, data-movement instruction sets</li>
<li>Out-of-order superscalar architectures : we will study techniques to measure different micro-architectural characteristics of your desktop/laptop/mobile processors through software micro-benchmarks</li>
<li>Store buffers, Speculation</li>
<li>Mathematical framework to reason about latency and throughput: Amdahl's law, Little's law</li>
<li>Memory hierarchy : caching structures, types; micro-benchmarks to measure the memory hierarchy; compiler algorithms to exploit the memory hierarchy.</li>
<li>Virtual memory : huge page support, OS algorithms to manage huge pages; implications for big-data workloads.</li>
<li>Instruction Prefetching, Trace caches</li>
<li>Networking hardware/software : high-throughput network programming interfaces, multi-queue hardware, scheduling and fairness.</li>
<li>Storage element characteristics : SSD, HDD, throughput/latency optimization algorithms and tradeoffs.</li>
<li>Programming models like MapReduce, TensorFlow for domain-specific applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lab assignments</h2>
We will have assignments primarily based on programming and
measurement on x86-based systems to supplement the
course material. The assignment load is expected to be moderate.
