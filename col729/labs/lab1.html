<p>In this assignment, we will examine the effect of different compiler optimization passes on program performance.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks with Clang for 32-bit x86</li>
<li>Experiment with different optimization permutations and combinations and observe the difference made by each optimization option (or pair of optimization options), etc. We would like to evaluate the depth and detail in which you have performed this investigation
<ul>
<li>You can compile a C program to LLVM bitcode using the following command (similar commands should be available for other languages)
<pre>
clang -target i386 -emit-llvm &lt;compiler-options&gt; foo.c
</pre>
Please check the clang documentation on your own.
</li>
<li>You can link multiple bitcode files into a single bitcode file using the following command
<pre>
llvm-link foo.bc bar.bc
</pre>
</li>
<li>You can run optimization passes on the LLVM bitcode using the following command
<pre>
opt &lt;optimization-options&gt; foo.bc
</pre>
Please check the <code>opt</code> tool's documentation on your own.
</li>
<li>Generate code from LLVM bitcode to the target assembly (32-bit or 64-bit x86):
<pre>
llc foo.bc
</pre>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<b>Prepare a report summarizing your findings</b>: Your report should be succinct yet insightful. It should talk about the most consequential optimizations (to runtime) and the least consequential optimizations. Do some optimizations depend on each other: which ones? How does the order of application of the optimisations impact the runtime?
