<p>In this assignment, we will benchmark a few common C/C++ applications and examine the effect of different
compilers and different compiler optimization passes on program performance.

<h3>Set up</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install an Ubuntu 18.04 system</li>
<li>Install GCC and Clang
<pre>
sudo apt-get install gcc clang
</pre>
</li>
<li>Install ICC by obtaining the academic license: <a href=https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software/student>Follow these instructions</a>.
</li>
<li>Build SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks with GCC, Clang, ICC
<pre>
Instructions coming soon . . .
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learn about benchmarking</h3>
Look at the video on "Benchmarking C++ Code" by Bryce Adelstein-Lelbach posted on the <a href=../references.html>references</a> page.

<h3>Run with different compilers</h3>
Benchmark the SPEC CPU 2017 suite with different compilers, namely GCC, Clang, ICC. Prepare a report summarizing your benchmarking methodology and results. What are your high-level conclusions?

<p>Instructions coming soon . . .

<h3>Enable/disable different optimizations in LLVM</h3>
Benchmark the SPEC CPU 2017 suite after enabling/disabling different combinations of optimizations, to see which optimizations matter most on modern hardware/software stacks. What are your conclusions?

<p>Instructions coming soon . . .
