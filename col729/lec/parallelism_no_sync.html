<h2>Finding Synchronization-Free Parallelism</h2>
These techniques also help improving locality in the program --- because all dependent accesses get clustered together, and all independent cluster of accesses get separated (to be executed on independent processors), we can run the independent clusters one by one on the same processor. This way, accesses that have dependencies (and thus reuse) will be closer in time.
